# Problem Statement

Create a live retail billing system with:
- Staff-side fast billing (scan, add, pay)
- Owner-side live monitoring (sales feed, stock alerts, simple analytics)
- Lightweight backend using Supabase with RLS and realtime notifications

Hackathon mapping: focuses on full-stack integration, real-time UX, and secure data access.
